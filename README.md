# AI Programming Exam Miniproject

For this miniproject, we developed a combination of Procedurally Generating Content in forms of a dungeon generator, where we could place a Target and a Player object inside, which would then use the A* Pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest and cheapest path to the target. 

A demo can be seen on this link:

Some bugs and inconsistencies are still present in the project, as it works more as a Proof of Concept.
